# Machine-learning-final-project
Team member: Longtao lyu
For this project, I implement the KNN Algorithm and apply it over the Boston Housing Dataset to build a prediction model.
To improve the performance of the model, I also ensemble learning to improve the results.

Data source can be found in the data file. 
Code is in final_project notebook.
